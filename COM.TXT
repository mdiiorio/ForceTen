                           Revolutionary BBS Software!


	Well, this is Doo/2 (Not permanent (maybe)).  Written completly from 
scratch in C (Turbo C++ of course).  Hmmm, well, below I will describe my
routines, etc..

ÄÄo Message Bases

Major topic that took some time (all of homeroom!) to develop..


ø File structure of Message Bases:

	All files dealing with message bases are stored in the Supprt Directory.
The Index to all the boards in the current conference is stored in ccMSG.IDX,
with "cc" being the current conference number.  The header, which contains
such information as Title, Poster, Msg. Number, etc., is stored in a file
called ccMSGbb.HDR, with "cc" being the current conference and "bb" being the
current board number.  Probabaly the most important information the header
file stores is the pointers to data and the next message.  It is stored in
two varibles: datapoint and nextpoint.  "nextpoint" is the number-pointer to 
the next message.  "datapoint" is the byte-pointer to the text data.  This is
held in the file called ccMSGbb.DAT, each block of text is serparated by a 
(null).  This is shown as follows:


  Header                      Data
 
  ------
  | 0  | <- 1st msg #
  ------ 5                -> ------ 0
->| 2  |                  |  |    |
| | 0  | <-----------------  |    |
| ------ 25   |              --00-- 200
| | 3  |      |              |    |
| | 200|      |              |    |
| ------ 45   |              --00-- 400
| | 0  |      |              |    |
| | 400|      |              |    |
| ------ 65   |              --00-- 600
|             |
|             |
|             -> Pointer to current message data
|
|
-> Pointer to next header data
